# Yelp-Data-Analysis

INTRODUCTION

The objective of this project is data analysis and extraction of useful and helpful
information using various approaches. The various relationships and knowledge is
usually hidden inside raw data. Therefore, it is important to perform data cleaning and
data indexing before performing analysis. The reason for this is to remove redundancies
and errors which could cause flawed data analysis leading to inaccurate conclusions.

The data set used for this analysis is the Yelp Dataset, obtained from Yelp which is a
service that publishes user opinionated reviews about businesses within various cities.
It is a platform used by customers to give their personal ratings about local businesses.

The Yelp Dataset consists of different businesses, users, reviews and ratings given by
users. The database consists of 11 different tables:

● hours
● checkin
● attribute
● photo
● review
● business
● friend
● user
● tip
● elite_years
● category

Each of the tables have their individual primary keys and also have foreign keys linking
the various tables.
